# Combining clojure.spec with design recipes

_(Note: Each `####` marks the beginning of one slide.)_

## Background

### Systematic Software Design

#### How could we Approach Programming?

- "Tinker Until It Works"
(What we usually do.)

1. (While True): Tinker
2. (When it works):
 - "It WORKS!!"
3. GOTO 1.

_(Does this actually work? Not really...)_

_("Is there any other way?")_

#### _Systematic_ Software Design

#### _Systematic_ Software Design?

#### _Systematic_ Software Design!

- systematic thought, planning, and understanding.
- from the very beginning, at every stage, and for every step.

#### Systematic Software Design

- Design Recipes (The Scope of this Tutorial)
- Iterative Refinement (Out of the Scope of this Tutorial)

#### Design Recipes

- Many Recipes
  - Programs
    - Interactive (GUI/TUI)
    - Batch (Input --> Output)
  - Functions
- One Common Design Process

(What's New here? --> **Intermediate products** for beginner-level programs)

#### Design Recipes: (Generic) Steps

1. Problem Analysis --> Data Definitions
2. Signature, Purpose Statement, Header
3. Examples
4. Template
5. Definition (Code)
6. Testing

### Domain-Driven Design (Domain Modeling made Functional)

### Software Specification (clojure.spec)
